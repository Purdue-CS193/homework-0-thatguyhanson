# Hanson's First CS193 Homework
## Welcome to Hanson Huang's Website!

## Who am I?
Hello, my name is Hanson Huang. I am a freshman majoring in Computer Science. I was born in New York City but I lived in Michigan City, Indiana for most of my life. I am coming into Computer Science with barely any experience in programming, however, with the help of my friends I hope I can learn to program better by the end of this school year.

### My Favorite Things About CS193
- It is an easy class
- It is taught by students
- It helps me understand how to use Github and how to exploit the terminal
- It allowed me to make this website!
